# Cardiovascular-Disease-Risk-Prediction-using-LLM
This project explores cardiovascular disease risk prediction using Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot and few-shot prompting and also compared for ML models. We evaluate model performance across different shot settings (0, 5, 10, 15) on clinical free-text data to analyze classification accuracy and generalization.
